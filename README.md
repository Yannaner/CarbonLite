# CarbonLite

Inspiration

Climate change and environmental degradation are among the most critical challenges of our time. While awareness has grown, many individuals still struggle to translate knowledge into actionable change. This is where CarbonLite comes in. I aimed to create a solution that doesnâ€™t just inform but actively engages users in sustainable living. By integrating personalized AI-driven suggestions, CarbonLite empowers users to make small, impactful choices that collectively lead to a healthier planet.

What It Does

CarbonLite is an AI-powered virtual companion designed to guide users toward a more sustainable lifestyle. Through an interactive chatbot interface, users can:

Receive personalized sustainability recommendations tailored to their daily habits and lifestyle.

Get actionable advice on eco-friendly habits, such as reducing energy consumption, choosing sustainable products, and adopting greener transportation methods.

Integrate with health apps, purchase histories, and transportation data (with user permission) to offer highly customized suggestions.

Track their progress, build streaks, and stay motivated with gamified sustainability goals.

Access a rich library of educational content on sustainability to deepen their understanding and commitment to eco-friendly practices.

CarbonLite leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide real-time, conversational support. The platform enhances social engagement by motivating users to share and compare their sustainability progress with others, fostering a global network of environmentally conscious individuals.

How I Built It
