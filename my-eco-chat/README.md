# My Eco Chat – Expo Application

My Eco Chat is an Expo-powered mobile application built using `create-expo-app`. It leverages file-based routing to streamline navigation and provides multiple options for running the app—from local development builds to full-featured mobile testing using Expo Go.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js & npm**: Version 14 or later is recommended.
- **Expo CLI (Optional)**: While you can use `npx expo` directly, installing Expo CLI globally can be useful:
```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
```
## Supported Platforms:
Android: An Android emulator or a physical device with the Expo Go app installed.
iOS: An iOS simulator (macOS only) or a physical device with Expo Go.
Web: Any modern browser.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the CarbonLite repository and navigate to the my-eco-chat directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yannaner/CarbonLite.git
cd CarbonLite/my-eco-chat
```
2. Install Dependencies
Install all project dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the Application:
```
npx expo start
```

Once the server starts, you'll see options to open the app in various environments:

- Development Build: Run a live version of your app.
- Android Emulator: Launch the app in your configured Android emulator.
- iOS Simulator: Start the app in an iOS simulator (macOS required).
- Expo Go: Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device for a sandbox experience.
